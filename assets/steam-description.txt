[h1]Overview[/h1]

Does what [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2499031295]Leader Traits: All Eligible Species Traits[/url] does for species-based leader traits, but for Machine Units - they gain the Synthetic leader traits.  Requested by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198257383427]Marrow[/url].

[h1]Changes[/h1]

Adds new effects, events, and on_action hooks to ensure Machine Unit leaders gain the same special traits as Synthetic leaders.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

All the mod's logic is implemented in standalone events and effects which should not conflict with other mods.  Does [b]not[/b] require Leader Traits: All Eligible Species Traits.

Not included in my compilation mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522974089]Subtle Polish: A Collection of Fixes and Enhancements[/url].  This mod is compatible with the compilation.

Built for Stellaris version 3.1.* "Lem."  Not compatible with achievements.
