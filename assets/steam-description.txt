[b][i]DEPRECATED:[/i][/b] Paradox has applied this change in 3.6 "Orion" alongside overall changes to ascension paths - if you have that version or higher, do not use this mod. It remains listed for players who choose to play the 3.4 "Cepheus" versions of Stellaris.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Does what [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2499031295]Leader Traits: All Eligible Species Traits[/url] does for species-based leader traits, but for Machine Units - they gain the Synthetic leader traits.  In order to qualify, the Machine Unit leader(s) must belong to a Machine Intelligence with the Synthetic Age ascension perk, to a non-gestalt empire with the Synthetic Personality Matrix technology, or an Ancient Machine Intelligence.

Requested by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198257383427]Marrow[/url].

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Adds new effects, events, and on_action hooks to ensure Machine Unit leaders gain the same special traits as Synthetic leaders.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
All the mod's logic is implemented in standalone events and effects which should not conflict with other mods.  Does [b]not[/b] require Leader Traits: All Eligible Species Traits.

Built for Stellaris version 3.4 "Cepheus."  Not compatible with achievements.
